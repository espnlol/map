          This tool ranks start/sit decisions using real season and career statistics from public NFL data — not a
          proprietary rating service. Every recommendation shows its component numbers so you can judge them
          yourself rather than trust a single opaque score. Where the ideal data doesn't exist for free (see below),
          this uses the closest honest substitute and says so, rather than making something up.

            — an open, community-maintained NFL data project, licensed CC-BY 4.0. Every weekly box score you see
            here (targets, yards, receptions, fantasy points) is computed from play-by-play directly, because
            nflverse's own precomputed "player_stats" convenience file has been frozen since May 2025 and never
            updated for the current season.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cornerback coverage and pass-rush stats (targets allowed, completion% allowed, pressures, hurries,
            hits, sacks) come from Pro Football Reference's advanced stats, via nflverse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fantasy points are standard full-PPR, computed from the box score. Your league's actual scoring (0.5
            PPR, TE premium, return TDs, bonus thresholds) may differ slightly.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
          There is no free, public data on which specific defender covered which specific receiver on a given
          play — that's the kind of all-22 charting PFF and NFL Next Gen Stats sell, not something available via
          open data. What this shows instead is each cornerback's own season-long coverage performance
          (targets, completion% allowed, yards per target, passer rating allowed), for the corners who've actually
          played the most defensive snaps at the position this season. Treat it as "how good has this corner been
          in coverage," not "this corner will be on this receiver."

        <SectionLabel>Offensive line vs. pass rush</SectionLabel>
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
          Per-lineman pass-block grades are PFF's paywalled product — there's no free equivalent. As the best
          available substitute, an offense's O-line quality is proxied by how often its own quarterback(s) have
          been pressured this season (from PFR's pressure stats): a lower pressure rate implies better protection.
          This is a whole-offense number, not a per-player grade, and it's affected by more than the offensive
          line alone (scheme, quarterback mobility, play calling). Opposing pass rushers are shown individually
          (their real pressures/hurries/hits/sacks), along with their pressure rate specifically in games against
          offensive lines that graded out in the same tier as the matchup you're looking at.

          Each opponent's current defensive coordinator is shown for context next to the quarterback's history
          against that defense. This list was built from web search rather than a structured, verifiable feed —
          Wikipedia and team sites were both unreachable from the environment this was built in — and it has{' '}
          <strong>not</strong> been checked against a primary source. Two entries were dropped outright because
          the sources contradicted each other. Coordinators also get fired mid-season. Confirm any name you're
          relying on, and treat a blank team as "not verified" rather than "no coordinator."

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
          Importing your roster from ESPN calls ESPN's own (undocumented) fantasy API from this app's server, so a
          private league's cookies never reach your browser's network tab. That call could not be tested against a
          real league while building this, because this environment's network policy blocks espn.com outright. It
          follows the request shape the fantasy-tooling community has reverse-engineered over the years, but
          verify it works for your league before relying on it — manual search is always available as a fallback
          and is the better-tested path.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
          Every "this season" stat shows its game count (n=). Early in the year that number can be 1 or 2 games —
          treat those as noisy, and lean more on the "last season" figures shown alongside them until the sample
          grows.
