# Fourth Quarter — Start/Sit Matchup Analyzer

A weekly fantasy football start/sit tool for your own lineup. Add your WRs and
RBs and it pulls their real matchup for the week — opponent history, defensive
tendencies, and (for WR/RB specifically, per how this was scoped) the coverage
and pass-rush detail below — and shows a transparent lean with every number
that went into it. It never collapses that down to a single unexplained score.

## What it actually checks

**For a WR:**
- The receiver's own career history against this specific opponent.
- The opponent's pass defense allowed to the WR position — this season, last
  season, and the last 4 games.
- The opponent's most-used cornerbacks' season-long coverage stats (targets,
  completion% allowed, yards/target, passer rating allowed).
- The starting QB's history against this defense, with the opponent's current
  defensive coordinator shown alongside it for context.

**For a RB:**
- The same own-history and run-defense-allowed splits as above.
- The RB's own offensive line pass-block quality this season (proxied from
  the team's own QB pressure rate — see Methodology below for why).
- The opponent's individual pass rushers' real production this season
  (pressures/hurries/hits/sacks), including their rate specifically in games
  against offensive lines rated the same tier as this matchup.

Every one of those is a real, live, computed number — never a guess dressed
up as one. Where the ideal data isn't publicly available for free (true
per-play coverage assignments, per-lineman pass-block grades), the app uses
the closest honest substitute and says so explicitly, both in the app's
**Methodology** tab and below.

## Running it

```bash
npm install        # also installs server/ (postinstall)
npm run dev         # client on :5173 (proxies /api to the server), server on :8787
npm run build        # typecheck + production client build to dist/
npm run typecheck
```

For production, `cd server && npm run build && npm start` serves the built
client and the API from one Node process on `$PORT` (default 8787).

No API keys or accounts are required for the core matchup analysis — it pulls
directly from nflverse's public data on every cold request and caches it to
`server/.cache/` (gitignored) with a several-hour TTL. Use the **Refresh
data** button in the header to force a re-pull mid-session.

### Optional: connect your ESPN league

The dashboard's roster is manual-add by default (search, click, done —
persisted in your browser's local storage, never sent anywhere but this app's
own server). There's also a best-effort ESPN import: enter your league ID and
team ID (and, for a private league, your `espn_s2`/`SWID` session cookies) and
it fetches your roster server-side, so private-league cookies never touch
your browser's network tab. **This could not be tested against a real ESPN
league** while building it — the sandbox this was built in blocks network
access to espn.com entirely — so treat it as unverified until you've tried it
against your own league. Manual search always works and is the better-tested
path.

### Why weekly stats are computed from play-by-play, not nflverse's own "player_stats" file

nflverse publishes a convenient pre-aggregated weekly player-stats file that
almost every fantasy tool built on this ecosystem uses. While building this,
that file (and its per-position offense/defense/kicking variants) turned out
to be **frozen since May 2025** — it stops mid-way through the 2024 season
and was never updated for 2025 or 2026, even though it's still served with a
current `Last-Modified` header. Rather than silently ship stale data, this
app rebuilds the same weekly box scores directly from nflverse's play-by-play
release (the `pbp` tag), which **is** updated same-day. Fantasy points are
computed as standard full-PPR from that box score; your league's exact
scoring settings (0.5 PPR, TE premium, return TDs, fumble/2-point rules) may
differ slightly. If nflverse's own file starts updating again, swapping back
would simplify `server/src/lib/datasets.ts`, but there's no need to wait on
that.

### Cornerback matchups — what this is and isn't

There's no free, public data on which specific defender covered which
specific receiver on a given play. That's the kind of all-22 charting PFF and
NFL Next Gen Stats sell, not open data. What's shown instead is each
cornerback's own season-long coverage performance, for the corners who've
actually played the most defensive snaps at the position this season (real
game participation, not a scraped depth chart — see below for why that
distinction mattered). Read it as "how good has this corner been in
coverage," not "this corner will be matched on this receiver."

### Offensive line vs. pass rush — what this is and isn't

Per-lineman pass-block grades are PFF's paywalled product; there's no free
equivalent. As the best available substitute, an offense's O-line quality is
proxied by how often its own quarterback(s) have been pressured this season
(from PFR's pressure stats): a lower pressure rate implies better protection.
That's a whole-offense number, not a per-player grade, and it's shaped by
more than the O-line alone (scheme, QB mobility, play calling). The
opponent's individual pass rushers are still shown with their real,
individual production, plus their pressure rate specifically in games
against O-lines that graded into the same tier as the matchup being viewed.

### Defensive coordinators — unverified, on purpose flagged as such

Each opponent's current DC is shown next to the QB-vs-defense history, for
context (e.g. "this history is against a totally different coordinator").
`server/config/coordinators.json` was assembled from web search rather than a
structured feed — Wikipedia and team sites were both unreachable from the
build environment — and has **not** been checked against a primary source.
Two entries that came back contradictory (the same person credited to two
teams) were dropped rather than guessed at; a few teams have no entry at all
for the same reason. It's a plain, hand-editable JSON file — fix anything
you know to be wrong, and prefer leaving a team `null` over guessing, since a
wrong name is worse than an honest gap here.

### Depth charts vs. snap counts

nflverse's `depth_charts` release is a rolling log of every intraday
snapshot all season (not one current snapshot), and — independent of that —
depth-chart projections can simply be stale or wrong between games. Every
"who's the starter" decision in this app (starting QB, most-used corners)
is instead resolved from **actual snap counts** in games already played,
falling back to the depth chart only before Week 1 snap data exists.

## Known limitations

- WR and RB only. QB/TE roster entries are shown but not analyzed — the
  request this was built for was specifically about receivers and backs.
- Early in a season, "this season" splits can be a 1-2 game sample. Every
  such stat shows its game count; the UI surfaces last season's full-sample
  numbers right alongside it for exactly this reason.
- The composite "lean" is a transparent weighted average of the percentiles
  shown beneath it — not a validated predictive model. Treat it as a
  starting point for your own judgment, not a verdict.
