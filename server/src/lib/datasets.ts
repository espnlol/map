/**
 * nflverse's convenience "player_stats" release (weekly fantasy/box-score stats with opponent) has been frozen
 * since May 2025 — it stops mid-way through the 2024 season and was never updated for 2025/2026, on both its
 * combined file and its per-season/offense/defense/kicking variants. Rather than serve silently stale data, this
 * rebuilds the same shape directly from nflverse's play-by-play release (the "pbp" tag), which IS updated same-day.
 * Fantasy points are computed here as standard full-PPR from the aggregated box score; a league's exact scoring
 * settings (0.5 PPR, TE premium, return TDs, 2pt/fumble rules) may differ slightly from this.
